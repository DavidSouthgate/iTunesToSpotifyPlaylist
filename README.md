# iTunes To Spotify Playlist
Reads an iTunes playlist and converts it into a format that Spotify can understand if the track is in the Spotify streaming library.

## Update 1st June 2016
Huh. Turns out you can just goto File > Import Playlists > iTunes to import iTunes playlists in Spotify. I'm pretty sure this wasn't a feature when I started this project. Although that method of importing heavily uses Spotify local files which often don't seem to link to the correct track in the Spotify for me.

##Usage
- Select Playlist from Combo Box at top of Window
- Wait for playlist details to load
- Click 'Get Spotify Playlist' to start process of getting Spotify playlist
- Once process is complete you will be able to import the playlist into Spotify. If any items failed to be imported, the number of failures will be displayed at the top of the window.
- Copy the playlist string
- Open Spotify, create a new playlist and give it a name
- Press CTRL+V when in the new empty playlist.
- The items should now be imported.
